    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A Santa Maria tri-tip marinade of spices and herbs makes this recipe
      spectacular. The town of Santa Maria, California, is home to one of
      America's most delicious barbecue specialties: black-on-the-outside,
      pink-on-the-inside, grilled beef tri-tip steak. The tri-tip is cut from
      the bottom sirloin and when cooked properly, produces a very flavorful,
      incredibly juicy piece of beef. The prep time will be about 20 minutes 
      and the cooking time 25 minutes with an additional time of 4 hours for 
      refrigeration.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) beef tri-tip roast
            <li>⅓ cup red wine vinegar</li></li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves crushed garlic</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Stir salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, rosemary, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl.        </li>
        <li>Place tri-tip in a glass baking dish and coat on all sides with spice mixture. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Combine vinegar, vegetable oil, crushed garlic, and Dijon mustard in a sealable container. Cover the container and shake until ingredients are blended.</li>
        <li>Remove tri-tip from the refrigerator. Let sit uncovered at room temperature for 30 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; lightly oil the grates.</li>
        <li>Place tri-tip on the preheated grill and brush with vinegar mixture. Cook for 4 minutes, flip, and baste. Flip and baste every 4 minutes until tri-tip starts to firm up and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 25 to 30 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
